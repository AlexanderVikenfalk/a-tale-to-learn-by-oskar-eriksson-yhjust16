Hero says- hmm the streets are really quiet tonight, almost to quiet.

Then our mysterious hero with an super cool mask hears a loud scream echoing through the alley.
Screaming lady in need -Oh noo please someone help me!!

Hero -Theres a lady in need, i need to save her!
Our rather brave mysterious hero sets off for the sound with his coat flying in the wind.
