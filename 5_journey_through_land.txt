The screams got louder and louder, our hero was getting close...

When he finally reached the womans location, he saw that the perpetrator was holding a knife against her and forced her to give him her money.

- STOP! Yelled our hero. The villian saw that it was an enormous humanbird yelling at him (the coat didnt really cover his large wings..), so he got startled and ran away.

As the villian escaped, our hero saw where he went and proceeded to follow him. The night grows increasingly darker as our hero makes his way down the street towards the villians lair.
